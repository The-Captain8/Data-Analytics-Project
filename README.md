# Data-Analytics-Project
Project.ipynb contains all of the code needed to generate the graphs.
The first code block requires the raw data which can be downloaded at [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage/resources/hard-drive-test-data).

After placing all of the CSV's into a folder, you are able to change the paths in the Python code and it should output `data.feather`.
The `data.feather` file is what the rest of the code loads and it is pretty small, so I've included it in the repository.

The report, proposal, and final presentation are all included in the repository as well.
